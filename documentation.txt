Hello and welcome to Digital Logic Sim 2 reposiory, which is a project created by UkrainianBanderasCat using Sebastien Lague's original work, Digital Logic Sim.
In this file, I will overview the currently existing files and explain some of their functions.

SCRIPTS :

1 - Save System

a. ChipDelete.cs :
      - ConfirmDelete : Is called when the delete key is pressed while hovering the chip name (in the lower bar) , opens a panel.
          When cancel is clicked on this panel, it closes it. If Global is clicked, DeleteGlobal() is called. If Local is clicked, DeleteLocal() is called.
         
      - DeleteFile : Is called both in  DeleteGlobal and DeleteLocal functions. Check if a file exist and, if yes , deletes it and refresh (Manager.RefreshAll() )
          the manager. Takes a string argument, which is the path of the file which needs to be deleted
          
      - DeleteLocal : Is called when "Local" is clicked on the panel. Find the paths of the chip and its wire layout save file and delete them by calling
          DeleteFile(path) twice where path are the WireLayout path and the Chip path.
          
      - DeleteGlobal : Is called when "Global" is clicked on the panel. Find the global paths of the chip and its wire layout save file and delete them by calling
          DeleteFile(path) twice where path are the WireLayout path and the Chip path. Then , calls DeleteLocal() to delete the files in the local project.
